# Network coursework
It is a network simulation program created as part of the university coursework.

# Features
- you can add, remove and configure each node and connection
- the scene can be saved and restored from a JSON file
- it uses distance-vector routing
- 2 metrics of shortest distance searching between nodes: "ByWeights" and "ByNodes"
- visual highlighting of shortest distance between selected nodes
- simulates 3 sending modes between nodes: datagram mode, logical connection mode, virtual connection mode
- has 2 simulation options: "realtime" and "fast result"
- after the simulation, you get windows with rich simulation results with full logs of the simulation

# Dependencies
The Qt Libraries - http://qt-project.org/downloads
